QUESTIONS
- if getpwuid() returns NULL, what can we check for error?
- What if the username is too long?
    - max in netbsd is tryingtocreateau (16 chars)

NOTES
- fork,exec - new process created
- text segment - intialized variables
- function you call gets added to the stack
- uninitialized data - arrays
- recursive calls lead to a stack overflow
- pmap(1) and pmap(9) TRY!
- readelf -h a.out -> ELF file
- libc_start_main is the routine for starting main()
- cc -e specify entry point
- If no explicit return is specified, return is the last return value
eg printf("yo\n") returns 3
- You can also overflow the stack by modifying the environment variables - environ
- _exit and _Exit also exist
- abort() exits by sending a signal to the process
- if envp gets too big, it is dynamically allocated in the heap
- realloc -> change the region size
- alloca - allocate the memory to the stack so that you dont lose the mallocs region after the function call
- reservation and keeping track of memory region is a black box
- cc -static h -> static linking, not dynamic linking
- MAC OSX does not allow dynamic linking
- getrlimit and setrlimit for modifying the process limits
- soft limit <= hard_limit
- ps wwaux | more -> view all the processes
- Zombie process - dead process that has not been reaped by init
- init usually reaps all the dead processes
