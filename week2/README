#HW1: trivially copy a file

The program copies a file from a source_path to a destination_path based on what is provided in the command line arguments.

STEP 1: run 'make'
STEP 2: run the program ./tcp

usage: tcp source_path destination_path

example: tcp /etc/passwd file2
	 tcp ../hw1.txt .


Possible source & destination paths are

- Directory
- Filepath
- Symbolic link
- Hard link

The permissions of the written file are identical to those of the read file. Important functions used are
- stat(2)
- open(2)
- read(2)
- write(2)
- close(2)

Using the time program, I chose the best BUFFERSIZE.

time ./testcp.sh -p ./tcp

OUTPUTS-
WITH BUFFSIZE 16384
 All 25 tests passed.
       99.95 real         3.52 user        71.60 sys

WITH BUFFSIZE 32678- BEST
All 25 tests passed.
       95.92 real         2.85 user        69.84 sys

      
WITH BUFFSIZE 65536
All 25 tests passed.
       96.39 real         3.24 user        69.48 sys


I determined that the best BUFFERSIZE was 32678.

A few checks that I had to do were
- Check if same source and destination file, in which case do not copy and return ERROR
- If directory is provided, create new file with same permissions as source file
- Handle symlinks and hardlinks
- Truncate a file first to avoid any differences in source and destination files
