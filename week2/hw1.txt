CS631 -- Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment - HW#1
HW#1: trivially copy a file
Summary
The objective of this assignment is for you to write your first program and get comfortable developing a tool from a given specification.

Problem assignment
Write a simple program to copy a file following the specification in this manual page. For an extra 10 points, also implement the tcpm(1) tool. Your program will:

follow the general homework guidelines
be written in C (not C++ or anything else)
not generate any output other than error messages when appropriate
be accompanied by a Makefile, README, and checklist
Testing functionality
You can test the functionality of your program using this script. Please note that passing all tests there is necessary, but not sufficient for a good grade. As explained in class, code quality and cleanliness will factor into your grade.

Deliverables and Due Date
You will submit a single tar archive named username-hw2.tar that will extract into a directory named after your username. In that directory will be the files tcp.c, Makefile, README, and checklist.

For example, I would create my submission like this:


$ whoami
jschauma
$ mkdir jschauma
$ cd jschauma
$ vi tcp.c
$ vi Makefile
$ vi README
$ vi checklist
$ cd ..
$ tar zcf jschauma-hw1.tar jschauma
The due date for this assignment is 2018-09-17 16:00:00 EDT. Please attach the file to an email sent from your @stevens.edu email address to jschauma@stevens.edu with a subject of "[CS631] HW1".
