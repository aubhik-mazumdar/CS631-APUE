QUESTIONS
Why is ls a fork + exec?
Does SIGTTOU also suspend stderr messages?

IPC
- Asynchronous in nature
- Semaphore is basically a counter
- Identifier and key uniquely identifies a synchronization structure
- terminating a process frees the lock
- Data Structure still exists after the termination of the process. Semaphore also still exists
ipcs -p
ipcs -s

- Very similar to file I/O
- The semaphore crosses the boundary between the kernel and the process multiple times
- Shared memory, you dont need to cross the boundary multiple times. It resides in user space
- Shared memory is the fastest form of IPC
- Access issues though
- Information is stored in there and persists
- Message queues deliver messages in order
