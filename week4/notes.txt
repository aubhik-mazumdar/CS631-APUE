- To run ls you need execute permissions on the directory
- opendir doesnt need execute permissions but open does
- permissions changes take effect immediately but if the handle is open it doesnt matter
- Every directory has a minimum of 2 hard links
- Root directory has parent = itself
- rmdir . or .. is prevented by the file system
- there is not rm system call and only unlink
- there is no mv system call only rename
- readlink is used for reading the contents of a sylink file
- ls -lu -> last access time
- use fts
- cd doesnt exist...its a shell builtin
- To be POSIX compliant, you need to have a cd binary in /usr/bin but cd is in the shell


PASSWORDS AND GROUPS
- You can have 2 users with the same uid but different uname
- You can be a part of 2 groups. Each group has a password. Primary group is in /etc/passwd rest are in /etc/group
- uname in cmdline can lie to you (you can set it) but the command in C will not
- time.h /usr/include/time.h for time_t struct (look at it)
